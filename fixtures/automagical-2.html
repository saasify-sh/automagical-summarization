<p>In 2016, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg told Buzzfeed:</p>

<blockquote>[I] would not be surprised if &mdash; you fast-forward five years, most of the content that people see &hellip; and are sharing on a day-to-day basis is video.</blockquote>

<p>If you&rsquo;re not already executing on an aggressive video content creation strategy, you&rsquo;re falling behind. You&rsquo;re like the phone book. Don&rsquo;t be the phone book.</p>

<p>If the success of content marketing largely stems from taking a customer-first approach, it stands to reason that you should be delivering content in the medium customers prefer &mdash; namely video.</p>

<blockquote><strong>So tell me, hotshot, if video is so amazing why are you feeding me this long &lt;redacted&gt; blog post?</strong></blockquote>

<p>That&rsquo;s actually a great question. Tell you what, I&rsquo;ll drop a video created from this blog post at the bottom of the post.</p>

<blockquote><strong>When is it reasonable to desire to be a phone book?</strong></blockquote>

<p>Only if you&rsquo;re literally stuck in the 80&rsquo;s. And I don&rsquo;t mean <em>&ldquo;well I have big hair and have been to 73 Rush concerts.&rdquo; </em>I mean hitting 88 MpH in your DeLorean and winding up in the 80's.</p>

<blockquote>There&rsquo;s just one problem&hellip;</blockquote>

<p>YOU&rsquo;RE good at creating great <em>written</em> content. But videos&hellip; that&rsquo;s not your cup o&rsquo; tea. Which is why one of these three things usually happens:</p>

<ul><li>You spend days creating a &ldquo;good&rdquo; video, and headaches later, you wonder if your time could&rsquo;ve been better spent on something else.</li><li>You hack something together in a few hours. But it sucks, no one engages and you swear off video as ineffective snake oil (something you&rsquo;ll regret later).</li><li>You shell out money to a freelancer and they rake you over the coals for a price no person should pay for a short video.</li></ul>

<p>Sound terrible? It is. <strong>That&rsquo;s why we created Automagical</strong>.</p>

<p>We wanted to build a company that allows you to captivate social audiences with videos that can easily be created from written content, blog posts and news articles, at scale and affordably.</p>

<p>Automagical&rsquo;s AI can analyze and interpret the most interesting and relevant parts of your text content, and summarize it automatically into a storyboard. You can edit anything you like using our intuitive editor, and then publish it right to social. Easy.</p>

<p>But don&rsquo;t take my word for it, feel free to <a data-href="https://app.automagical.ai/sandbox" href="https://app.automagical.ai/sandbox">play in our sandbox</a> environment, and try it for yourself.</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>
