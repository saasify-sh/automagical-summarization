<p>The iconic Airstream silver bullet just got smaller, good news if you don&rsquo;t drive a full-size pickup.</p>

<p>the Airstream Basecamp. With a base weight of 2,585 pounds, you can (<a href="http://www.subaru.com/guides/outback/my16/Shop/Specs">just barely</a>) pull it behind a Subaru Outback.</p>

<p>Loaded with gear, it has a trailer capacity of 3,500 pounds. You&rsquo;ll need a slightly larger truck for that.</p>

<p>But most small pickups and SUVs, and many crossovers, can also easily handle a pull-behind in the 2,500 &ndash; 3,500 pound range.</p>

<p><strong>It is the lightest trailer in the Airstream fleet,</strong> which, combined with an aggressive departure angle, large wheels and tires, and aggressive side flares, makes uneven terrain accessible and towing easier.</p>
