<p>Account-based marketing (ABM) is a popular and much-hyped movement in today&rsquo;s B2B marketing strategy space. Most practitioners and thought leaders agree that optimized data, CRM, and Marketing Automation play a critical role in any account-based approach. ABM can create and drive the right prospects into the funnel, create better engagement, and increase the ROI on strategic accounts in your business. The most effective ABM programs require a multi-channel approach that keeps your company&rsquo;s message in front of key decision makers at your target accounts.</p>

According to Forrester, ABM is still a greenfield market as 64% of B2B marketers have yet to initiate account-based activities. The delay in action can be attributed to the top three challenges to implementing ABM cited marketing leadership.</p>
