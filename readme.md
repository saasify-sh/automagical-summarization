# automagical-summarization

> Powerful text summarization as a service hosted by [Saasify](https://saasify.sh).

This project provides a hosted, SaaS version of the open source [text-summarization](https://github.com/transitive-bullshit/text-summarization) module by [Automagical](https://automagical.ai), which was [acquired by Verblio in 2018](https://www.verblio.com/blog/we-bought-a-company).

## Features

- Uses a variety of metrics to generate quality extractive text summaries
- Summarizes html or text content
- Utilizes html structure as a signal of text importance
- Includes basic abstractive shortening of extracted sentences
- Thoroughly tested and used in production

## Examples

```
curl -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data"
  -F "input=@fixtures/automagical-2.html"
```

## Metrics

- tfidf overlap for base relative sentence importance
- html node boosts for tags like `<h1>` and `<strong>`
- listicle boosts for lists like `2) second item`
- penalty for poor readability or really long sentences

Here's an example of a sentence's internal structure after normalization, processing, and scoring:

```js
{
  "index": 8,
  "sentence": {
    "original": "4. For the cost of 1 highly produced video, you can get a year's worth of videos from Automagical.",
    "listItem": 4,
    "actual": "For the cost of 1 highly produced video, you can get a year's worth of videos from Automagical.",
    "normalized": "for the cost of 1 highly produced video you can get a years worth of videos from automagical",
    "tokenized": [
      "cost",
      "highly",
      "produced",
      "video",
      "years",
      "worth",
      "videos",
      "automagical"
    ]
  },
  "liScore": 1,
  "nodeScore": 0.7,
  "readabilityPenalty": 0,
  "tfidfScore": 0.8019447657605553,
  "score": 5.601944765760555
}
```
