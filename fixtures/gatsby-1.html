<h4>Moja Gear is a community-driven blog for all things climbing and outdoors.</h4>

<p>The Moja Gear team uses social media and giveaways to promote content, add subscribers, and increase affiliate revenue. Prior to Gatsby, they used Google Docs to run giveaways, but prefer Gatsby for it's sleek user experience, social automation, and identification of authentic micro-influencers.</p>

<p>They spent about <strong>1 hour</strong> designing and launching their giveaway on Gatsby, and within the first week, received:</p>

<ul> <li><strong>651</strong> social profiles</li> <li><strong>651</strong> giveaway entries / newsletter subscribers</li> <li><strong>165</strong> authentic Facebook shares</li> <li><strong>124</strong> new Instagram followers</li> </ul>

<p>Of their 2,835 clicks on their Gatsby button in week 1, <strong>23% completed the social action</strong> and entered the giveaway.</p>

<blockquote>&quot;We've tried half a dozen tools to run giveaways, but Gatsby is undoubtedly the best experience for our users. Not only does it look sleek on our site, but it performs exceptionally well and provides unparalleled data insights.&rdquo;</blockquote>
